Description=Initialize database schema for 42ity services
# ordering of upgrade->init is weird, but makes a sense
# 1. on a first bool fty-db-init is started when license is accepted and
#    fty-db-upgrade is skipped due ConditionPathExists there
# 2. on other boots fty-db-upgrade runst firs and fty-db-init is skipped due
#    ConditionPathExists, so it's a depenency for db dependent services
After=mysql.service fty-db-upgrade.service
Requires=mysql.service
Conflicts=shutdown.target
#do not run if database has been already initialized
ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/fty/sql/mysql/bios-db-rw
