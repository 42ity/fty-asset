# fty-asset

fty-asset is an agent managing information about assets.
Assets are either locations (datacenter, room, row, rack) or devices (RC, UPS, EPDU, etc.).

## How to build

To build fty-asset project run:

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check # to run self-test
```

## How to run

To run fty-asset project:

* from within the source tree, run:

```bash
./src/fty-asset
```

For the other options available, refer to the manual page of fty-asset

* from an installed base, using systemd, run:

```bash
systemctl start fty-asset
```

Agent also has a command line interface fty-asset-cli.

For further information, refer to the manual page of fty-asset-cli.

### Configuration file

Configuration file - fty-asset.cfg - is currently ignored.
Agent reads environment variable BIOS\_ASSETS\_REPEAT, which sets how often are all the assets republished on ASSETS stream.

## Architecture

### Overview

fty-asset is composed of 3 actors:

* asset-server: does general asset management
* asset-autoupdate: publishes inventory messages when available information about RCs changes
* asset-inventory: parses inventory messages and stores their content into DB

In addition to actors, there are 2 timers:

* asset server timer: runs every BIOS\_ASSET\_REPEATS seconds (by default once every hour) and triggers republish of all known assets on ASSETS stream
* autoupdate timer: runs once in a 5 minutes and triggers update of information about all RCs

## Protocols

### Published metrics

Agent doesn't publish any metrics.

### Published alerts

Agent doesn't publish any alerts.

### Mailbox requests

It is possible to request the fty-asset agent for:

* power topology chains,
* republishing assets,
* list of assets in given container,
* list of assets of given type/subtype,
* creation and updating of assets,
* user-friendly name of given asset,
* all the data available about given asset

#### Power topology

The USER peer sends the following messages using MAILBOX SEND to
FTY-ASSET-AGENT ("asset-agent") peer:

* REQUEST/'uuid'/POWER/'asset-iname'

where
* '/' indicates a multipart string message
* 'asset-iname' MUST be the asset iname
* 'uuid' is the correlation id of the message
* subject of the message MUST be TOPOLOGY

The FTY-ASSET-AGENT peer MUST respond with one of the messages back to USER
peer using MAILBOX SEND.

* 'uuid'/REPLY/POWER/'asset-iname'/OK/'D1'/.../'Dn'
* 'uuid'/REPLY/POWER/'asset-iname'/ERROR/reason

where
* '/' indicates a multipart frame message
* 'asset-iname' MUST be the same as in request
* 'uuid' MUST be the same as in request
* 'D1',...,'Dn' MUST be assets in the power topology of 'asset-iname'
* 'reason' is a standard message (JSON payload) describing the error

Example of bmsg request:
```bash
bmsg request asset-agent TOPOLOGY REQUEST 1234 POWER server-17
```

#### Upstream topology of the nearest energy chain of a powered asset

The USER peer sends the following messages using MAILBOX SEND to
FTY-ASSET-AGENT ("asset-agent") peer:

* REQUEST/'uuid'/POWER\_TO/'asset-iname'

where
* '/' indicates a multipart string message
* 'asset-iname' MUST be the asset iname
* 'uuid' is the correlation id of the message
* subject of the message MUST be TOPOLOGY

The FTY-ASSET-AGENT peer MUST respond with one of the messages back to USER
peer using MAILBOX SEND.

* 'uuid'/REPLY/POWER\_TO/'asset-iname'/OK/\<powerchains\>
* 'uuid'/REPLY/POWER\_TO/'asset-iname'/ERROR/reason

where
* '/' indicates a multipart frame message
* 'asset-iname' MUST be the same as in request
* 'uuid' MUST be the same as in request
* 'reason' is a standard message (JSON payload) describing the error
* \<powerchains\> is a unique frame (JSON payload) as:
```bash
{
    "asset-id": "<asset-iname>",
    "powerchains": [
        {
            "src-id": "<D1>",
            "src-socket": "<D1-id>",
            "dst-id": "<asset-iname>"
        },
        ...,
        {
            "src-id": "<Dn>",
            "src-socket": "<Dn-id>",
            "dst-id": "<asset-iname>"
        }
    ]
}
```
    with
    * 'D1',...,'Dn' the assets in the upstream powerchain topology of 'asset-iname'
    * 'D1-id',...,'Dn-id' the corresponding socket identifiers (src-id outlet)

Example of bmsg request:
```bash
bmsg request asset-agent TOPOLOGY REQUEST 1234 POWER_TO server-17
```
with response (unique frame for the JSON payload):
```bash
1234
REPLY
POWER_TO
server-17
OK
{
	"asset-id": "server-17",
	"powerchains": [
		{
			"src-id": "epdu-13",
			"src-socket": "7",
			"dst-id": "server-17"
		},
		{
			"src-id": "epdu-10",
			"src-socket": "1",
			"dst-id": "server-17"
		}
	]
}
```

### Stream subscriptions

Agent is subscribed to ASSETS stream.

If it receives inventory message, asset-inventory actor extracts data from it and puts them into DB.
If it receives any other asset message, asset-server actor for all the children of this asset:

* updates power topology

* updates stored data

* publishes update message on ASSETS stream
